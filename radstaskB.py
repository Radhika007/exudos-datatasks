''' Task B. '''

# task to update already inserted mongodb document objects present
# in collection "students"
# to use references to other objects in database (for nested custom data models)
# use case: programme,
#           school,
#           user

# (i) create corresponding User objects for list of all Students inserted above
# (ii) create and insert an object to db for Programme('B.B.A.') with its details
# (iii) schools objects are already present in the db,
#       use the ObjectId() for the SoM object in collection "schools"
#       to use it as reference for all Students inserted above
# (iv) link users with corresponding students and students with corresponding users

# final stage: db.students.find().pretty() example output
